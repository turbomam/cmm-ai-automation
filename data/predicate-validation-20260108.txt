## Issues Found

### Critical Issues

1. **biolink:is_assessed_by** - NOT FOUND
   - This predicate is used in kg-microbe data but does not exist in Biolink Model v4.3.6
   - Action Required: Investigate usage in kg-microbe and either:
     a) Replace with a valid Biolink predicate
     b) Request addition to Biolink Model if this is a needed predicate
     c) Verify if this is a typo (should it be a different predicate?)

### No Deprecation Issues

- None of the predicates are marked as deprecated or obsolete in either ontology
- All METPO predicates are current and active (as of 2025-12-12 release)
- All found Biolink predicates are current and active (as of v4.3.6)

## Usage Statistics

From kg-microbe predicate analysis (2026-01-08 build):

- **METPO predicates**: 2,517,546 edges (72.9%)
- **biolink predicates**: 937,401 edges (27.1%)
- **Total edges**: 3,454,947

The heavy use of METPO predicates reflects the domain-specific nature of microbial metabolic and phenotypic data, which requires specialized predicates beyond what Biolink Model provides for general biomedical knowledge graphs.

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Investigate and resolve the use of `biolink:is_assessed_by` in kg-microbe data
2. Consider documenting the rationale for using domain-specific METPO predicates alongside standard Biolink predicates
3. Monitor both Biolink Model and METPO releases for any deprecations or changes to these predicates
4. Ensure proper prefix handling in KGX files (biolink: vs METPO:)

## Validation Methodology

- Biolink predicates checked against: biolink-model.yaml (v4.3.6, modified 2024-12-19)
- METPO predicates checked against: metpo-full.obo (v2025-12-12)
- All predicates from kg-microbe-predicate-analysis-20260108.txt were validated
- Deprecation status checked for all predicates
- No deprecated or obsolete predicates found in either ontology
